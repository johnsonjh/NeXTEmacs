Distribution
************

GNUS is "free"; this means that everyone is free to use it and free
to redistribute it on a free basis.  GNUS is not in the public domain;
it is copyrighted and there are restrictions on its distribution, but
these restrictions are designed to permit everything that a good
cooperating citizen would want to do.  What is not allowed is to try to
prevent others from further sharing any version of GNUS that they might
get from you.  The precise conditions appears following this section.

The easiest way to get a copy of GNUS is from someone else who has it.
You need not ask for permission to do so, or tell any one else; just
copy it.

If you have access to the Internet, you can get the latest version of
GNUS from tut.cis.ohio-state.edu [128.146.8.60] using anonymous ftp.
You can also get it from osu-cis using anonymous uucp.

You may also receive GNUS when you buy a computer.  Computer
manufacturers are free to distribute copies on the same terms that apply
to everyone else.  These terms require them to give you the full
sources, including whatever changes they may have made, and to permit
you to redistribute the GNUS received from them under the usual terms of
the General Public License.  In other words, the program must be free
for you when you get it, not just free for the manufacturer.

If you cannot get a copy in any of those ways, you can order one from
the author using electronic mail.  For further information, write to:

     umerin@flab.flab.Fujitsu.CO.JP, or
     umerin%flab.flab.Fujitsu.JUNET@uunet.uu.NET

If you cannot reach the author using these addresses, try the following
mailing list:

     info-gnus-english@tut.cis.ohio-state.edu

The list is intended to exchange useful information about GNUS, such as
bug reports, useful hooks, and extensions.  Feel free to ask about the
nearest machine that has GNUS installed.  Subscription request of this
list should be sent to:

     info-gnus-english-request@tut.cis.ohio-state.edu

GNUS General Public License
***************************
                        (Clarified 13 Jan 1989)

  The license agreements of most software companies keep you at the
mercy of those companies.  By contrast, our general public license is
intended to give everyone the right to share GNUS.  To make sure that
you get the rights we want you to have, we need to make restrictions
that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender
the rights.  Hence this license agreement.

  Specifically, we want to make sure that you have the right to give
away copies of GNUS, that you receive source code or else can get it if
you want it, that you can change GNUS or use pieces of it in new free
programs, and that you know you can do these things.

  To make sure that everyone has such rights, we have to forbid you to
deprive anyone else of these rights.  For example, if you distribute
copies of GNUS, you must give the recipients all the rights that you
have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
code.  And you must tell them their rights.

  Also, for our own protection, we must make certain that everyone finds
out that there is no warranty for GNUS.  If GNUS is modified by someone
else and passed on, we want its recipients to know that what they have
is not what we distributed, so that any problems introduced by others
will not reflect on our reputation.

  Therefore I (Masanobu Umeda) use the following terms, which are
written for GNU Emacs by Richard Stallman and the Free Software
Foundation, Inc.  They say what you must do to be allowed to distribute
or change GNU Emacs.  You can know your right to distribute or change
GNUS by replacing any occurrences of GNU Emacs with GNUS.  Please apply
the same policies to GNUS as GNU Emacs.


Copying Policies
================

  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of GNU Emacs source code as
     you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
     appropriately publish on each file a valid copyright notice "Copyright
     (C) 1988 Free Software Foundation, Inc." (or with whatever
     year is appropriate); keep intact the notices on all files that refer to
     this License Agreement and to the absence of any warranty; and give any
     other recipients of the GNU Emacs program a copy of this License
     Agreement along with the program.  You may charge a distribution fee for
     the physical act of transferring a copy.

  2. You may modify your copy or copies of GNU Emacs source code or
     any portion of it, and copy and distribute such modifications under
     the terms of Paragraph 1 above, provided that you also do the following:

        * cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating
          who last changed such files and the date of any change; and

        * cause the whole of any work that you distribute or publish, that
          in whole or in part contains or is a derivative of GNU Emacs or any
          part thereof, to be licensed at no charge to all third parties on
          terms identical to those contained in this License Agreement
          (except that you may choose to grant more extensive warranty
          protection to some or all third parties, at your option).

        * if the modified program serves as a text editor, cause it, when
          started running in the simplest and usual way, to print an
          announcement including a valid copyright notice "Copyright
          (C) 1988 Free Software Foundation, Inc." (or with the
          year that is appropriate), saying that there is no warranty (or
          else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may
          redistribute the program under these conditions, and telling the
          user how to view a copy of this License Agreement.

        * You may charge a distribution fee for the physical act of
          transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty
          protection in exchange for a fee.

     Mere aggregation of another unrelated program with this program (or its
     derivative) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring
     the other program under the scope of these terms.

  3. You may copy and distribute GNU Emacs (or a portion or derivative of it,
     under Paragraph 2) in object code or executable form under the terms
     of Paragraphs 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the
     following:

        * accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
          source code, which must be distributed under the terms of
          Paragraphs 1 and 2 above; or,

        * accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
          years, to give any third party free (except for a nominal
          shipping charge) a complete machine-readable copy of the
          corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of
          Paragraphs 1 and 2 above; or,

        * accompany it with the information you received as to where the
          corresponding source code may be obtained.  (This alternative is
          allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
          received the program in object code or executable form alone.)

     For an executable file, complete source code means all the source code
     for all modules it contains; but, as a special exception, it need not
     include source code for modules which are standard libraries that
     accompany the operating system on which the executable file runs.

  4. You may not copy, sublicense, distribute or transfer GNU Emacs except
     as expressly provided under this License Agreement.  Any attempt
     otherwise to copy, sublicense, distribute or transfer GNU Emacs is
     void and your rights to use GNU Emacs under this License agreement
     shall be automatically terminated.  However, parties who have received
     computer software programs from you with this License Agreement will
     not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in
     full compliance.

  5. If you wish to incorporate parts of GNU Emacs into other free programs
     whose distribution conditions are different, write to the Free Software
     Foundation.  We have not yet worked out a simple rule that can be stated
     here, but we will often permit this.  We will be guided by the two goals of
     preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of
     promoting the sharing and reuse of software.

Your comments and suggestions about our licensing policies and our
software are welcome!  Please contact the Free Software Foundation, Inc.,
675 Mass Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139.

Introduction
************

  GNUS is a program for reading and writing network news of USENET using
GNU Emacs.  This manual documents the use and simple customization of
the GNUS.

  Unlike other conventional newsreaders such as rn which was (:-) the
most popular newsreader in the world, GNUS runs inside GNU Emacs editor
as a subsystem.  This means that there is no need to invoke editors each
time when composing articles or mail.  Reading and writing of articles
can be done in the same Emacs environment you usually work in.

  Like rrn, a remote version of rn, GNUS can use computer networks for
retrieving articles.  This means that there is no need to have a local
copy of news spool, to mount a remote file system over the network, or
to run Emacs on a remote machine.  Its great advantage is to balance
loads and exploit resources of the entire computer system in a
distributed environment.  The protocol used by GNUS is "NNTP", the
Network News Transfer Protocol defined by RFC977.

  Unlike rrn, GNUS can talk to many NNTP servers easily.  The only thing
you have to do is to create startup files for each NNTP server.

  Like other libraries of GNU Emacs, GNUS is completely written in Emacs
lisp.  This means that GNUS is highly extensible and customizable just
like GNU Emacs.  It is possible to change the behavior of GNUS and
extend its functions by using variables and hooks.

  GNUS is pronounced *"NUZ"*.  Never call it *"ghu-NUZ"* nor
*"ghu-NAS"*.

  This manual is currently in progress and thus is incomplete.  Your
suggestions, bug fixes, and contributions are welcome.

Installing GNUS
***************

  Installation of GNUS and some initializations of your computing
environment are described in this chapter.  Please read the following
sections carefully before getting started with GNUS.

* Menu:

* Files of GNUS::       How many files of GNUS are there?
* Compilation::         How to byte-compile lisp sources.
* Autoloading::         How to define autoload entries.
* Environment::         How to define your environment.
* Texinfo Manual::      How to install an Info file and print the manual.


File: gnus  Node: Files of GNUS, Prev: Installation, Up: Installation, Next: Compilation

Files of GNUS
=============

  Unpacking the shar files will produce the following files.  They are
Emacs lisp sources, a C source, and a Texinfo manual of GNUS.

`gnus.el'
     Main part of GNUS newsreader.

`nntp.el'
     NNTP package.

`nnspool.el'
     Patches to `nntp.el' for spool access.

`mhspool.el'
     Patches to `nnspool.el' for private directory access.

`tcp.el'
     Patches to old GNU Emacs which does not have a function
     `open-network-stream'.

`tcp.c'
     C program for external TCP/IP implementation.  This is used with
     `tcp.el'.

`gnus.texinfo'
     Texinfo manual of GNUS.


File: gnus  Node: Compilation, Prev: Files of GNUS, Up: Installation, Next: Autoloading

Byte-Compilation
================

  Move the lisp files to the appropriate directory in the search path
defined by the variable `load-path'.  Before actually byte-compiling the
lisp files, make sure there are no byte-compiled files of older versions
of GNUS in that directory.  Remove or rename such files as the
byte-compiler may be got confused with old macro definitions.

  The C file `tcp.c' should be compiled with a C compiler and installed
in a directory in the search path defined by the variable `exec-path',
if this is required.

  Byte-compile lisp files in the following order according to your
computing environment:

  1. Byte-compile `nntp.el' and `gnus.el' in this order.

  2. Byte-compile `nnspool.el' if you want to use a local news spool of
     your machine instead of NNTP (*Note Local News Spool::).

  3. Byte-compile `mhspool.el' if you want to read articles or mail in
     your private directory using GNUS (*Note Private Directory::).

  4. Compile and install `tcp.el' and `tcp.c' if TCP/IP stream is not
     supported by Emacs but is supported by your operating system.

  `tcp.el' defines the function `open-network-stream', and `tcp.c' is an
emulation program of the stream which is called from that function.  If
you modified `tcp.c' for your system, please send the author the diffs.
Some of them will be included in the future releases of GNUS.


File: gnus  Node: Autoloading, Prev: Compilation, Up: Installation, Next: Environment

Autoloading
===========

  It is useful to define autoload entries in `.emacs', `site-init.el' or
`default.el' as follows:

     (autoload 'gnus "gnus" "Read network news." t)
     (autoload 'gnus-post-news "gnus" "Post news." t)


File: gnus  Node: Environment, Prev: Autoloading, Up: Installation, Next: Texinfo Manual

Environment
===========

  The NNTP server and its service name, your domain and organization,
and other important definitions of your computing environment are
described in this section.  Since these definitions depend heavily on
your environment, you'd better be familiar with the operating system you
are using and an abstract of USENET.

* Menu:

* Server:  NNTP Server.         How to define NNTP server.
* Service: NNTP Service.        How to define NNTP service.
* Domain::                      How to define your domain and organization.
* GENERICFROM::                 How to use GENERICFROM feature.
* GENERICPATH::                 How to use GENERICPATH feature.
* Startup File::                About the startup files of GNUS.


File: gnus  Node: NNTP Server, Prev: Environment, Up: Environment, Next: NNTP Service

NNTP Server
-----------

  The variable `gnus-nntp-server' specifies the default NNTP server.  To
define the server `flab', put the following codes in `.emacs',
`site-init.el' or `default.el':

     (setq gnus-nntp-server "flab")

  The variable `gnus-nntp-server' is initialized from the `NNTPSERVER'
environment variable.  To define the server using the `NNTPSERVER'
environment variable, put the following codes in `.login':

     setenv NNTPSERVER "flab"

  If an NNTP server is preceded by a colon such as `:Mail', the user's
private directory `~/Mail' is used as the news spool.  This makes it
possible to read mail stored in MH folders or articles saved by GNUS.
*Note Private Directory::, for more information.

  GNUS will ask you for the NNTP server at start up time unless it is
defined.  Even if the default server is defined, it is possible to
choose another server by invoking GNUS with a prefix argument like `C-u
M-x gnus' (*Note Getting Started::).


File: gnus  Node: NNTP Service, Prev: NNTP Server, Up: Environment, Next: Domain

NNTP Service
------------

  The default service name of NNTP is `"nntp"'.  You may, however, have
to define the service name as the number `119' as follows:

     (setq gnus-nntp-service 119)

  If you'd like to use a local news spool of your machine directly
instead of NNTP, set the variable to `nil' as follows:

     (setq gnus-nntp-service nil)

In this case, the NNTP server must be a local host name returned by the
function `system-name' (*Note Local News Spool::).


File: gnus  Node: Domain, Prev: NNTP Service, Up: Environment, Next: GENERICFROM

Domain and Organization
-----------------------

  "Domain" and "organization" must be defined before you post your first
article, because they are included in all articles you post, and will be
used for identifying who you are.

  "Domain" is the domain part of your mail address excluding the local
host name.  For example, if your mail address is
`umerin@photon.stars.flab.Fujitsu.JUNET' and the local host name is
`photon', your domain is `stars.flab.Fujitsu.JUNET'.  If the function
`system-name' of your Emacs returns the full Internet name, you do not
have to define the domain.

  "Organization" is the organization you belong to.  It must be defined
unconditionally.

  To define the domain `stars.flab.Fujitsu.JUNET' and the organization
`Fujitsu Laboratories Ltd., Kawasaki, Japan.' using lisp variables, put
the following codes in `.emacs', `site-init.el' or `default.el'.  If you
are a system administrator and installing GNUS for other users,
`site-init.el' is the best place to define them because the domain and
organization are common to all users of the system.

     (setq gnus-your-domain "stars.flab.Fujitsu.JUNET")
     (setq gnus-your-organization
           "Fujitsu Laboratories Ltd., Kawasaki, Japan.")

  The `DOMAINNAME' and `ORGANIZATION' environment variables are used
instead if defined.  To define these variables, put the following codes
in `.login'.

     setenv DOMAINNAME   "stars.flab.Fujitsu.JUNET"
     setenv ORGANIZATION "Fujitsu Laboratories Ltd., Kawasaki, Japan."


File: gnus  Node: GENERICFROM, Prev: Domain, Up: Environment, Next: GENERICPATH

GENERICFROM
-----------

  If the variable `gnus-use-generic-from' is non-`nil', the local host
name of your machine will not appear in the `From:' field of article
headers you post.  This is called the "GENERICFROM" feature in the Bnews
system.  This may be useful if there are many workstations connected to
each other in a local area network, and aliases service or automatic
forwarding of mail is supported between the workstations.

  To use the GENERICFROM, put the following codes in `.emacs',
`site-init.el' or `default.el'.  If you are a system administrator and
installing GNUS for other users, `site-init.el' is the best place to
define it because the definition is common to all users of the system
having the same domain and organization (*Note Domain and Organization:
Domain.).

     (setq gnus-use-generic-from t)

  As a special case of the GENERICFROM feature, if the variable
`gnus-use-generic-from' is a string, it is used as your domain instead
of the definition of the variable `gnus-your-domain' or the environment
variable `DOMAINNAME' (*Note Domain and Organization: Domain.).


File: gnus  Node: GENERICPATH, Prev: GENERICFROM, Up: Environment, Next: Startup File

GENERICPATH
-----------

  If the variable `gnus-use-generic-path' is `nil', the NNTP server name
followed by the user login name is used in the `Path:' field of article
headers you post.  If it is a string, the string followed by the user
login name is used instead.  Otherwise, if it is non-`nil', only the
user login name is used.  This is called the "GENERICPATH" feature in
the Bnews system.

  For example, to define the generic path `flab', put the following
codes in `.emacs', `site-init.el' or `default.el'.  If you are a system
administrator and installing GNUS for other users, `site-init.el' is the
best place to define it because the definition is common to all users of
the system having the same domain and organization (*Note Domain and
Organization: Domain.).

     (setq gnus-use-generic-path "flab")

In this case, the `Path:' field will be generated as `Path: flab!USER'.


File: gnus  Node: Startup File, Prev: GENERICPATH, Up: Environment

Startup File
------------

  "Startup file" is a file recording information on articles you have
already read.  GNUS uses `.newsrc' for the startup file as in the Bnews
system.  If you think you will talk to exactly one NNTP server, you can
use it without any problems.  Otherwise, if you want to talk to several
NNTP servers, you'd better use server specific startup files since
startup files are not portable between servers.  The server specific
startup file for an NNTP server on a machine SERVER is a file named
`.newsrc-SERVER'.  For example, `.newsrc-photon' is for an NNTP server
on a machine named `photon'.  The primary name of the startup file,
`.newsrc', is specified by the variable `gnus-startup-file' (*Note
Variables::).

  GNUS automatically adds newly created newsgroups to a startup file
when getting started.  To prevent adding the newsgroups under some
newsgroup hierarchies, you can use the options line in the startup file.
Option `-n' of the options line in the startup file is recognized
properly the same as for the Bnews system.  For example, if the options
line is `options -n !talk talk.rumors', newsgroups under the `talk'
hierarchy except for `talk.rumors' are ignored while checking new
newsgroups.  This is the only way to keep startup files small.  These
ignored newsgroups can be added manually using the command `U'
(`gnus-Group-unsubscribe-group') in the Newsgroup buffer (*Note
Maintenance::).

  Once a startup file is updated by GNUS, the "quick startup file" of
which the file name is generated by appending `.el' to that of the raw
startup file is also created.  The quick startup file can be read by
Emacs faster than the raw startup file since all information in the file
is in lisp form.  If there is a quick startup file and it is newer than
the raw startup file, the quick startup file is loaded instead of the
raw startup file.  If the raw startup file is newer, it is normally read
after loading the quick startup file.  You should not remove the quick
startup file because it contains additional information.  Instead, make
the raw startup file newer than that by touching it or force GNUS to
read it by using the command `gnus-Group-restart' if you want to reflect
the changes of the raw startup file to GNUS.


File: gnus  Node: Texinfo Manual, Prev: Environment, Up: Installation

Texinfo Manual
==============

  `gnus.texinfo' is a manual of GNUS written in Texinfo format.  This
file can be printed using TeX, and also can be read using Info Mode of
Emacs.

  *Note Creating an Info File: (texinfo)Creating an Info File, to create
an on-line Info file from the Texinfo manual.  If you are not allowed to
create the Info file in the standard Info directory specified by the
variable `Info-directory', create it in your private directory and set
the variable `gnus-Info-directory' to the directory.

  If this Info file is installed, you can read the documentation of GNUS
according to the current major mode of GNUS.  The command
`gnus-Info-find-node' to read the appropriate Info nodes of the Info
file is assigned to `C-c C-i' in all major modes of GNUS.

  *Note Printing Hardcopy: (texinfo)Printing Hardcopy, to print a
hardcopy of the manual.

  This chapter describes how to get started GNUS, how to use a local
news spool directly, and how to read private directory.

Getting Started GNUS
====================

  Type `M-x gnus' at the top level of GNU Emacs to invoke GNUS.  Unless
a default NNTP server is defined, you will be asked for the name of the
server.  The NNTP server can be changed at startup time by giving a
prefix argument to the command even if a default server is defined.
*Note NNTP Server::, to define the default server.

`M-x gnus'
     Run GNUS using the default NNTP server.

`C-u M-x gnus'
     Run GNUS without using the default NNTP server.


File: gnus  Node: Local News Spool, Prev: Getting Started, Up: Starting up, Next: Private Directory

Using Local News Spool
======================

  If the NNTP server is the local host name (exactly the same as the
value returned by the function `system-name'), and the variable
`gnus-nntp-service' is nil, GNUS looks up the local news spool of your
machine directly instead of NNTP (*Note NNTP Service::).

  It may be effective not to use NNTP for reducing network traffic even
if an NNTP server is running on the local machine.  Commands for
retrieving articles by Message-IDs may, however, take longer time than
for NNTP, or they may not work at all.  *Note Referencing Articles::, to
refer to articles by the Message-IDs, and *Note Spool Variables::, for
more information on the restrictions.


File: gnus  Node: Private Directory, Prev: Local News Spool, Up: Starting up

Reading a Private Directory
===========================

  If an NNTP server is preceded by a colon such as `:Mail', the user's
private directory `~/Mail' is used as the news spool.  This makes it
possible to read mail stored in MH folders or articles saved by GNUS.
An active file for the directory is generated from files of which the
file name consists of only numeric characters, and other files
containing non-numeric characters in their file name are ignored.

  If a private directory is specified as an NNTP server, GNUS loads the
lisp library `mhspool.el' (*Note Files of GNUS::).  Loading of this file
replaces some function definitions which are defined in `nntp.el' or
`nnspool.el' in Emacs.  This means that if you want to read articles
afterwards, you have to restore those definitions by loading `nntp.el'
or `nnspool.el'.  You'd better restart Emacs if you do not know what to
do in this case.

  A server specific startup file for each directory must be created
before starting GNUS.  For example, a startup file for the directory
`~/Mail' is a file named `.newsrc-:Mail'.  *Note Startup File::, for
more information on the server specific startup file.

Buffers of GNUS
***************

  GNUS uses three buffers of Emacs: Newsgroup buffer, Subject buffer,
and Article buffer.  Each of them is associated with a specific major
mode of Emacs.

* Menu:

* Newsgroup Buffer:: a buffer for listing newsgroups.
* Subject Buffer::   a buffer for listing subjects and other important headers.
* Article Buffer::   a buffer for displaying messages of articles.


File: gnus  Node: Newsgroup Buffer, Prev: Buffers of GNUS, Up: Buffers of GNUS, Next: Subject Buffer

Newsgroup Buffer
================

  "Newsgroup buffer" is for listing newsgroups.  The major mode of this
buffer is "Group Mode".  The buffer is created and popped up when GNUS
starts.  Newsgroups which are subscribed to and contain unread articles
are usually listed in the buffer.  If there is no such newsgroup, the
buffer will be empty and a message `No news is good news.' will be
displayed in the echo area of Emacs.

  The contents of a Newsgroup buffer looks something like the following:

     SM  NUMBER: NEWSGROUP

S
     A character indicating whether the newsgroup is subscribed to.  `U'
     means the newsgroup is unsubscribed.  ` ' means it is subscribed
     to.

M
     A character indicating whether there are unread articles in the
     newsgroup.  `*' means there are no newly arrived articles in the
     newsgroup.  ` ' means there are newly arrived articles.

NUMBER
     The number of unread articles in the newsgroup.

NEWSGROUP
     The name of the newsgroup.


File: gnus  Node: Subject Buffer, Prev: Newsgroup Buffer, Up: Buffers of GNUS, Next: Article Buffer

Subject Buffer
==============

  "Subject buffer" is for listing subjects and other important headers
of articles.  The major mode of the buffer is "Subject Mode".  The
buffer is created for each newsgroup when the newsgroup is selected in
the Newsgroup buffer.

  The contents of a Subject buffer looks something like the following:

     S NUMBER:C[LINES:AUTHOR] SUBJECT

S
     A character indicating whether an article is newly arrived.  ` '
     means the article is newly arrived.  `D' means it was read and
     marked so.  `-' means it was read once but marked as unread again.

NUMBER
     The number assigned to the article.

C
     A character indicating which article is currently selected.  `+' is
     placed on the current article.

LINES
     The number of lines of the article body.

AUTHOR
     Mail address of the author of the article.

SUBJECT
     Subject of the article.

  Strings between `[' and `]' are optional, and can be customized using
the variable `gnus-optional-headers'.  *Note Variables::, and *Note
Hooks::, for more information on customization.


File: gnus  Node: Article Buffer, Prev: Subject Buffer, Up: Buffers of GNUS

Article Buffer
==============

  "Article buffer" is for displaying articles.  The major mode of the
buffer is "Article Mode".  Very few commands are available in this
buffer because most operations on the buffer can be done in the Subject
buffer.

Newsgroup Commands
******************

  The Newsgroup buffer is intended to show newsgroups which are
subscribed to and contain unread articles.  Unsubscribed newsgroups or
newsgroups containing no unread articles are not usually displayed in
the buffer.

  Commands for browsing through newsgroups, selecting newsgroups to read
articles, and maintaining newsgroups are described in this chapter.

* Menu:

* Browsing Newsgroups::         Browsing through newsgroups.
* Selecting a Newsgroup::       Selecting a newsgroup to read articles.
* Maintenance::                 Maintaining newsgroups.
* Exiting GNUS::                How to exit GNUS.
* Other Newsgroup Commands::    Other miscellaneous commands.


File: gnus  Node: Browsing Newsgroups, Prev: Newsgroup Commands, Up: Newsgroup Commands, Next: Selecting a Newsgroup

Walking Around Newsgroups
=========================

  First of all, you have to move the point to a newsgroup to read
articles from the desired newsgroup.

`n'
     Move point to the next newsgroup containing unread articles
     (`gnus-Group-next-unread-group').

`p'
`DEL'
     Move point to the previous newsgroup containing unread articles
     (`gnus-Group-prev-unread-group').

`N'
`C-n'
     Move point to the next newsgroup (`gnus-Group-next-group').

`P'
`C-p'
     Move point to the previous newsgroup (`gnus-Group-prev-group').

`j NEWSGROUP RET'
     Move point to the specified NEWSGROUP (`gnus-Group-jump-to-group').

`/'
     Do an incremental search forward (`isearch-forward').

`<'
     Move point to the beginning of the buffer (`beginning-of-buffer').

`>'
     Move point to the end of the buffer (`end-of-buffer').

`r'
     Restrict visible newsgroups to the current region specified by the
     point and the mark (`gnus-Group-restrict-groups').

  The command `j' (`gnus-Group-jump-to-group') reads a newsgroup name
interactively, and moves the point to it.  If there is no such newsgroup
in the buffer, a line for the newsgroup is inserted at the beginning of
the buffer.

  The command `r' (`gnus-Group-restrict-groups') restricts visible
newsgroups to the current region specified by the point and the mark.
This is useful if you want to concentrate on a restricted set of
newsgroups in a region.  Type `C-x w' (`widen') to remove the
restriction.


File: gnus  Node: Selecting a Newsgroup, Prev: Browsing Newsgroups, Up: Newsgroup Commands, Next: Maintenance

Selecting a Newsgroup
=====================

  If you successfully move the point to a desired newsgroup, you can
select the newsgroup to read articles by typing `SPC'
(`gnus-Group-read-group') or `=' (`gnus-Group-select-group') on that
line.

`SPC'
     Select the newsgroup, and then select the first unread article
     automatically (`gnus-Group-read-group').

`='
     Select the newsgroup (`gnus-Group-select-group'). No article is
     selected automatically.

  To prevent automatic selection of the first unread article even when
the newsgroup is selected by the command SPC (`gnus-Group-read-group'),
set the variable `gnus-auto-select-first' to `nil'.  If you want to
change the value of the variable according to the selected newsgroups,
set the variable in the hook `gnus-Select-group-hook'.

  If unread articles are contained in a selected newsgroup, they become
ready to be read.  Otherwise, all articles in the newsgroup become ready
to be read.  All articles in a newsgroup can be selected unconditionally
by giving a prefix argument to the commands SPC and =
(`gnus-Group-read-group' and `gnus-Group-select-group').

  If the number of articles being selected is larger than the variable
`gnus-large-newsgroup', the number of articles actually selected is
asked for.  If the given value N is positive, the last N articles will
be selected.  If N is negative, the first N articles will be selected.
An empty string means to select all articles.

  *Note Variables::, and *Note Hooks::, for more information on
customization.


File: gnus  Node: Maintenance, Prev: Selecting a Newsgroup, Up: Newsgroup Commands, Next: Exiting GNUS

Maintaining Newsgroups
======================

  Subscription of newsgroups, deletion of bogus newsgroups, and other
related operations are described in this section.

`u'
     Unsubscribe from (or subscribe to) the newsgroup
     (`gnus-Group-unsubscribe-current-group').

`U NEWSGROUP RET'
     Unsubscribe from (or subscribe to) the specified NEWSGROUP
     (`gnus-Group-unsubscribe-group').  If it is not contained in the
     startup file, it is added to the file.

`c'
     Mark all articles as read in the newsgroup (`gnus-Group-catch-up').

`l'
     Redisplay newsgroups which are subscribed to and containing unread
     articles (`gnus-Group-list-groups').

`L'
     Display all newsgroups unconditionally
     (`gnus-Group-list-all-groups').

`b'
     Check bogus newsgroups (`gnus-Group-check-bogus-groups').  Bogus
     means non-active.

`g'
     Get newly arrived articles (`gnus-Group-get-new-news').  In fact,
     GNUS reads the active file from the NNTP server again.

`R'
     Force to read the raw startup file and get newly arrived articles
     (`gnus-Group-restart').

  The command `U' (`gnus-Group-unsubscribe-group') reads a newsgroup
name interactively, and toggles its subscription flag if it is already
in the startup file.  Otherwise, if it is not contained in the startup
file, it is added to the file.  Thus, you can add newly created
newsgroups manually which are not added automatically because of the
options line in the startup file.  *Note Startup File::, for more
information on the startup file and options line.

  The command `c' (`gnus-Group-catch-up') marks all articles as read in
a newsgroup.  Make sure that this command does not take account of
cross-reference information in the `Xref:' field, while the command `c'
(`gnus-Subject-catch-up-and-exit') in Subject Mode does.

  Only subscribed newsgroups containing unread articles are usually
displayed in the Newsgroup buffer.  Type `L'
(`gnus-Group-list-all-groups') to show all newsgroups which are
currently active.

  A "bogus newsgroup" is one not in the list of active newsgroups in the
active file.  Bogus newsgroups which are deleted or renamed must be
deleted from the startup file (*Note Startup File::) explicitly by the
command `b' (`gnus-Group-check-bogus-groups').

  If you want to change the order of newsgroups listed in the Newsgroup
buffer, edit the raw startup file by yourself using the ordinary Emacs
commands and then restart GNUS using the command `R'
(`gnus-Group-restart').  Generally speaking, if you want to reflect the
changes of the raw startup file to GNUS, the raw startup file must be
newer than the quick startup file.  *Note Startup File::, for more
information on the startup file.

  GNUS reads the active file at start up time to know about currently
active articles.  This information is not updated unless you force GNUS
to do so by using the command `g' (`gnus-Group-get-new-news') or the
command `R' (`gnus-Group-restart').


File: gnus  Node: Exiting GNUS, Prev: Maintenance, Up: Newsgroup Commands, Next: Other Newsgroup Commands

Exiting GNUS
============

`s'
`x'
     Update the startup file `.newsrc' (`gnus-Group-force-update').

`z'
     Suspend the current GNUS session to make it possible to resume it
     later (`gnus-Group-suspend').

`q'
     Update the startup file `.newsrc', and then exit GNUS
     (`gnus-Group-exit').

`Q'
     Exit GNUS without updating the startup file `.newsrc'
     (`gnus-Group-quit').

  If a GNUS session is suspended by the command `z'
(`gnus-Group-suspend'), it is possible to resume it later without any
time-consuming initializations.  Switch to the Newsgroup buffer and type
`g' (`gnus-Group-get-new-news') to get newly arrived articles if you
want to resume the suspended GNUS session.  It is a good idea to update
the startup file (*Note Startup File::) before suspending GNUS.

  If you want to forget what you read this GNUS session, exit GNUS by
the command `Q' (`gnus-Group-quit').  Otherwise, exit by the command `q'
(`gnus-Group-exit') to update the startup file.

  The hook `gnus-Exit-gnus-hook' is called when exiting or suspending
GNUS.  If you want to clear out Emacs buffers which were created by GNUS
and remain afterwards, use this hook.

Subject Commands
****************

  The Subject buffer is intended to show interesting headers of articles
in a newsgroup and to help you know what kind of discussions are held in
the newsgroup.  Messages of articles are displayed in the Article buffer
which is usually popped up automatically when necessary.  Scrolling of
the messages and most other commands on articles can be done in the
Subject buffer.

* Menu:

File: gnus  Node: Browsing Headers, Prev: Reading Articles, Up: Reading Articles, Next: Moving Among Articles

Walking Around Headers
----------------------

  The commands described here are for moving the point on headers.  Type
SPC (`gnus-Subject-next-page') or `g' (`gnus-Subject-show-article') to
read an article on the line (*Note Scrolling::).

`C-n'
     Move point to the next header (`gnus-Subject-next-subject').

`C-p'
     Move point to the previous header (`gnus-Subject-prev-subject').

`M-n'
     Move point to the next header, skipping marked articles
     (`gnus-Subject-next-unread-subject').

`M-p'
     Move point to the previous header, skipping marked articles
     (`gnus-Subject-prev-unread-subject').

`j NUMBER RET'
     Move point to the header specified by the article NUMBER
     (`gnus-Subject-goto-subject').

`/'
     Do an incremental search on headers (`isearch-forward').

  The command `delete-other-windows' to delete other windows is normally
assigned to `C-x 0'.  This command is very useful to show the Subject
buffer full window when browsing through many headers.  That is why this
command is also assigned to `=' in Subject Mode.

  Long lines in the Subject buffer are truncated and the continuation
lines are not displayed normally.  The command `C-t'
(`gnus-Subject-toggle-truncation') toggles the truncation of the lines
in the buffer.

`='
     Delete other windows to show the Subject buffer full window
     (`delete-other-windows').

`C-t'
     Toggle truncation of the Subjet buffer
     (`gnus-Subject-toggle-truncation').


File: gnus  Node: Moving Among Articles, Prev: Browsing Headers, Up: Reading Articles, Next: Scrolling

Moving Among Articles
---------------------

  The commands described here are for moving the point on headers, and
then automatically selecting articles afterward.

`n'
     Read the next article, skipping marked articles
     (`gnus-Subject-next-unread-article').

`p'
     Read the previous article, skipping marked articles
     (`gnus-Subject-prev-unread-article').

`N'
     Read the next article (`gnus-Subject-next-article').

`P'
     Read the previous article (`gnus-Subject-prev-article').

`M-C-n'
     Read the next article with the same subject as the current article
     (`gnus-Subject-next-same-subject').

`M-C-p'
     Read the previous article with the same subject as the current
     article (`gnus-Subject-prev-same-subject').

`M-x gnus-Subject-next-unread-same-subject'
     Read the next article with the same subject as the current article,
     skipping marked articles.

`M-x gnus-Subject-prev-unread-same-subject'
     Read the previous article with the same subject as the current
     article, skipping marked articles.

`.'
     Read the first unread article
     (`gnus-Subject-first-unread-article').

`l'
     Read the article selected last (`gnus-Subject-goto-last-article').

`J NUMBER RET'
     Read the article specified by the article NUMBER
     (`gnus-Subject-goto-article').

  If the variable `gnus-auto-select-same' is non-`nil', commands `n' and
`p' (`gnus-Subject-next-unread-article' and
`gnus-Subject-prev-unread-article') move the point to unread articles
with the same subject as the current article like the commands `M-x
gnus-Subject-next-unread-same-subject' and `M-x
gnus-Subject-prev-unread-same-subject', respectively.  If you are used
to running `rn -S', set the variable to non-`nil'.

  The variable `gnus-auto-select-next' defines the behavior of GNUS when
there is no unread article in the current newsgroup and a command
selecting the next unread article is executed.  If the variable is
non-`nil', the next newsgroup containing unread articles is selected
automatically.

  *Note Variables::, for more information on customization.


File: gnus  Node: Scrolling, Prev: Moving Among Articles, Up: Reading Articles, Next: Marking Articles

Scrolling Within an Article
---------------------------

  Type SPC (`gnus-Subject-next-page') to scroll to the next page of the
current article.  If no article is selected yet, an article near the
point is selected and its first page is displayed in the Article buffer.
The next unread article is selected automatically if SPC is typed at the
end of the message.

`SPC'
     Scroll to the next page of the current article
     (`gnus-Subject-next-page').  Select it first if no article is
     selected yet.  Select the next unread article automatically at the
     end of the message.

`DEL'
     Scroll to the previous page of the current article
     (`gnus-Subject-prev-page').

`RET'
     Scroll up or down one line of the current article
     (`gnus-Subject-scroll-up').

`<'
     Move point to the beginning of the current article
     (`gnus-Subject-beginning-of-article').

`>'
     Move point to the end of the current article
     (`gnus-Subject-end-of-article').

`w'
     Stop page breaking (`gnus-Subject-stop-page-breaking').

`v'
     Show all headers of the current article
     (`gnus-Subject-show-all-headers').

`t'
     Show all headers of the current article if pruned header currently
     shown, or vice versa (`gnus-Subject-toggle-header').

`C-c C-r'
     Caesar rotate letters by 13 places and Japanese characters by 47
     places (`gnus-Subject-caesar-message').

`g'
     Force to read the current article again
     (`gnus-Subject-show-article').

  If the Article buffer is not visible, it is popped up under the Subjet
buffer when necessary.  The height of the Subject buffer is specified by
the variable `gnus-subject-lines-height'.

  The command `C-c C-r' (`gnus-Subject-caesar-message') rotates all
letters in the message body of the current article by 13 places.
Japanese characters are rotated by 47 places.  Running the command twice
on the same article results the original message.

  If the variable `gnus-break-pages' is non-`nil', the message is broken
into pages at page delimiters specified by the variable
`gnus-page-delimiter'.  The variable `gnus-more-message' specifies a
message displayed at the end of the pages.  The command `w'
(`gnus-Subject-stop-page-breaking') temporary suspends page breaks.

  The variable `gnus-ignored-headers' specifies header fields which
should be ignored.  The command `v' (`gnus-Subject-show-all-headers')
shows all headers of the current article, while the command `t'
(`gnus-Subject-toggle-header') toggles the headers.
